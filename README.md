# KeyLogger

This code will continuously monitor keystrokes and write them to a file called `keystrokes_log.txt`. 

It uses the keyboard library which allows capturing keyboard events. 

Pressing the "esc" key terminates the program. 

Make sure to install the keyboard library using `pip install keyboard`. 

Also, be mindful of privacy and legal implications when using such a script.

There is one example log file called `keystroke_logger.py`.
